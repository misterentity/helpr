#### How to Get Your Plex Token

1. Sign in to your Plex account at https://app.plex.tv
2. Open any media item
3. Click the three dots menu (â‹¯) and select "Get Info"
4. Click "View XML"
5. Look for `X-Plex-Token` in the URL

Or follow the official guide: https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/

#### How to Generate a Secret Key

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

#### How to Generate a Password Hash

For security, admin passwords are stored as hashes. Generate your password hash:

```bash
python -c "from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash; print(generate_password_hash('your_password'))"
```

Copy the output and use it as your `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` value.

### 8. Run the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

#### Grandfather Existing Users
1. Go to `/admin/subscriptions`
2. Click "Grandfather Existing Users"
3. All users with successful invites become lifetime subscribers
4. They appear with "Grandfathered" badge

#### Library Settings
Configure default libraries (legacy mode):
1. Check boxes next to libraries to share
2. Click "Save Library Settings"
3. Note: Tier-based libraries override these defaults

## Configuration

### Subscription Tiers

Subscription tiers are the core of the platform. Each tier defines:

- **Pricing**: Monthly recurring price charged via Stripe
- **Libraries**: Which Plex libraries subscribers can access
- **Downloads**: Whether sync/download is enabled (allowSync in Plex)
- **Stripe Price ID**: Links to Stripe product pricing

Configure tiers at `/admin/tiers`.

### Free Tier Access

Grant complimentary access without payment:

1. Set `FREE_TIER_INVITE_CODE` in `.env`
2. Share this code with select users
3. They enter it on the plans page to get free access
4. Creates a grandfathered subscription (no expiry, no Stripe)

### Grandfathering

Migrate existing users to permanent access:

1. Use the "Grandfather Existing Users" button in `/admin/subscriptions`
2. All successful historic invites become lifetime subscriptions
3. Grandfathered users:
   - Show "Grandfathered" badge
   - No expiry date
   - No Stripe billing
   - Permanent access

### Library Settings (Legacy)

Default libraries can still be configured via the admin dashboard:
- Saved to `config.json`
- Used for free tier invites
- Overridden by tier-specific library settings

### Database

- **Development**: SQLite (DATABASE_PATH in `.env`)
- **Production**: PostgreSQL (DATABASE_URL or AZURE_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTIONSTRING)
- **Tables**: invite_requests, tiers, subscriptions
- **Migrations**: Automatic on startup via SQLAlchemy

## Security Considerations

### For Development

- The application runs in debug mode by default when using `run.py`
- Use Stripe test mode keys (pk_test_ and sk_test_)
- Test webhooks locally with Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/webhook/stripe`
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control

### For Production Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS**: **REQUIRED** - Stripe webhooks only work over HTTPS
2. **Stripe Live Keys**: Switch from test to live keys in production
3. **Webhook Endpoint**: Configure in Stripe Dashboard pointing to your domain
4. **Strong Credentials**: Use strong, unique passwords for admin access (stored as hashes)
5. **Secret Key**: Use a cryptographically secure random secret key
6. **WSGI Server**: Use a production WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
7. **Firewall**: Restrict access to necessary ports only
8. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting:
   - 5/minute on invite requests
   - 10/hour on checkout
   - 200/day, 50/hour globally
9. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated regularly
10. **CSRF Protection**: Enabled on all forms (webhooks exempt)
11. **Webhook Verification**: Always validates Stripe signatures
12. **Secrets Management**: Never expose Stripe secret keys in logs or errors

### Stripe Security Best Practices

1. **Never share** secret keys (sk_test_ or sk_live_)
2. **Rotate keys** immediately if compromised
3. **Verify webhook signatures** (handled automatically)
4. **Use HTTPS only** for production
5. **Monitor** Stripe Dashboard for unusual activity
6. **Test mode first** before going live
7. **Webhook URL** must be publicly accessible and secure

### Example Production Setup with Gunicorn

```bash
# Install Gunicorn
pip install gunicorn

# Run with Gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 "app:create_app()"
```

### Example Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plex Issues

**"Invalid Plex token" Error**
- Verify your Plex token is correct
- Ensure you have an active Plex Pass subscription
- Try regenerating your Plex token

**"Plex server not found" Error**
- Check that `PLEX_SERVER_NAME` matches your server name exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure your Plex server is running and accessible
- Verify you're using the correct Plex account

**"User already has access" Error**
- The user has already been invited or has existing access
- Check the Plex server's user management to verify
- For existing users, use tier management to update permissions

**Email Not Received**
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify the email address is correct and associated with a Plex account
- Plex emails may take a few minutes to arrive

### Stripe Issues

**Webhook Not Receiving Events**
1. Verify webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard is correct
2. Ensure URL is publicly accessible (not localhost in production)
3. Check webhook signing secret matches `.env`
4. Review webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard
5. For local testing, use Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/webhook/stripe`

**Payment Successful but No Plex Invite**
1. Check application logs for errors during webhook processing
2. Verify tier has Stripe Price ID configured
3. Check subscription was created in `/admin/subscriptions`
4. Manually send invite from subscription detail page if needed

**Checkout Session Creation Fails**
1. Verify Stripe keys are correct (test vs live)
2. Check tier has valid Stripe Price ID
3. Ensure Price ID is for recurring (not one-time) payment
4. Review Stripe Dashboard for product/price status

**Subscription Not Cancelling**
1. Check Stripe webhook events are being received
2. Verify `customer.subscription.deleted` event is configured
3. Manual revoke available in admin panel as fallback

### General Issues

**Background Jobs Not Running**
- APScheduler runs in-process with the app
- Check application logs for scheduler initialization
- For multi-worker deployments, ensure only one worker runs scheduler

**Database Errors**
- SQLite for development should work automatically
- PostgreSQL requires proper DATABASE_URL configuration
- Check database connection string format for Azure

**Access Not Revoked on Expiry**
- Background job runs daily at midnight
- Check application logs for job execution
- Manually revoke via admin panel if needed
- Verify Plex credentials allow friend management

**MRR Not Calculating**
- Only active, non-grandfathered subscriptions count toward MRR
- Refresh dashboard to see updated statistics
- Check tier pricing is set correctly
