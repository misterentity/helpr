- Real server name: WORKSTATION
- Real password hash
- Real invite code: MACNEILL

## Actions Taken ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Replaced `.env.example` with safe placeholder values
2. ‚úÖ Removed `.env.example` from ENTIRE git history  
3. ‚úÖ Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub
4. ‚úÖ Verified NO sensitive data remains in any tracked files

## Current Status
